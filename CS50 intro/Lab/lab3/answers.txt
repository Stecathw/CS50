sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?: If n is sorted, bubble sort should do better than other sorting algorithm, refering to Big O and Omega cheat sheet. 


sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?: If n is randomly sorted, then merge sort will do better than other sorting algorithm.


sort3 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?: If n is sorted, then it will be the worse scenario for this algorithm.
